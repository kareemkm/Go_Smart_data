Rice, fries, vegetables, soup and mezze starter are all thrown in for the cost of the fish, so excellent value. Well worth a visit!",

It is believed that this name has a religious connotation because it was also used as an adjective for the god-hero Sardus Pater, ?the Sardinian father? from Sardinian mythology. Sardinia was called \"Ecnosa\", which is the Latin word for the Greek \"Hyknusa\". It was also called Sandaleon, Sardinia and Sardu by the Greeks and Romans. What does our restaurant offer? Our restaurant offers a small but varied menu that satisfies all tastes. It varies between Grill and steak also pasta , pizza with some types of soup, salads and appetizers.

The hot rock dining and ballroom dancing! A piece of volcanic rock is heated for over several hours before being brought directly to your table. You then have the pleasure of being able to cook a dinner of your own choosing from a large and varied menu. Ancient cultures have been using this method for thousands of years, it is also very healthy as no oil or fat is used during the process, all the nutrients are sealed within. Hot rock dining is a very relaxed and sociable way to eat. There are no lengthy pauses in conversation when the plates of food are served and everybody \"tucks in\" as you cook the food at your own pace. This ensures that every last piece is hot and fresh. The whole method of dining becomes more leisurely and slower, where everybody tends to pause for conversation far more frequently. Only the freshet cuts of meat and fish are selected, you can choose from such sumptuous delights as Australian loin of lamb, black Angus beef ribs, Cajun salmon steaks, prawn and calamari skewers, plus much more.",
